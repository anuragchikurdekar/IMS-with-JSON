Making Purchases

While making purchases, I first imported json in python and opened the inventory file in read mode. Then, I wrote some inputs to be given by the user. I wrote the necessary statements which printed the bill of the purchase. I also wrote a statement updating inventory after purchase. For example. If a customer purchases 5 Candies where there are 200 candies in stock, printing the inventory after the purchase will show 195 candies in the stock.
I initiated an empty dictionary and using for loop, I calculated and appended the sales details in that dictionary after I gave an input asking for no. of total sales. I converted the file into json format and is attached with this project as sales.json.

Adding New Products

I imported json into Python and opened inventory file im read mode. Then I printed the file in coding environment. I called the key which wasn't already present in the dicitonary and assigned a value to it in dict format. After printing the inventory now will print the updated dictionary. 
Adding new products can also be done by requesting inputs from the user. Key and value both can be taken as input from user. Printing the dictionary after taking the inputs will print new key and value pair(s) along with other data in it.
